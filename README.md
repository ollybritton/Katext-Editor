# Katext Editor
I made this because I needed to print maths stuff off and put it on my wall.

## Instructions:
- Go to [this page]().
- Do mathsy stuff.

## Things I Probably Used:
- [Katex](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX): Fast math typesetting for the web.
- [Jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery): A javascript library for noobs.

*Katext... get it?*
